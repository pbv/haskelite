# Haskelite

This project is a single-step interpreter for a small subset of the
Haskell language including integers, booleans, lists, tuples and
recursive definitions. The principal focus is on simplicity since this
is intended for teaching fundamentals of functional programming.

This project is an extended re-implementation in Elm of the [Lambda
Lessons](https://stevekrouse.com/hs.js/) by Jan Paul Posma and Steve Krouse.

The interpreter is based on an abstract machine for a pattern matching
calculus described in a paper submitted to the IFL'2023 symposium.
Please contact me at <em>pbv at dcc dot fc dot up dot pt</em> if you
are interested in a draft copy.
