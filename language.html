<h2>Expressions</h2>

Integers, variables, arithmetic operations (`+, -, *, div, mod`),
comparisons between integers (`==`, `<=`, etc.), tuples, list enumerations
(e.g. `[1..10]`) lambda-expressions and if-then-else.

<h2>Function definitions</h2>

Pattern matching over integers, lists and tuples; recursive
definitions are allowed.


<h2>Standard Prelude</h2>

Definitions for the following functions from the Standard Prelude are provided.

<pre>
even, odd :: Int -> Bool
max, min :: Int -> Int -> Int
fst :: (a,b) -> a
snd :: (a,b) -> b
(&&), (||) :: Bool -> Bool
head :: [a] -> a
tail :: [a] -> [a]
(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
length :: [a] -> Int
reverse :: [a] -> [a]
sum, product :: [Int] -> Int
take, drop :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
repeat :: a -> [a]
cycle :: [a] -> [a]
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
takeWhile, dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
any, all :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
</pre>

<h2>Not implemented</h2>

The following Haskell 98 features are <em>not</em> implemented:

<ul>
<li><strike>static type checking</strike> type classes
<li>the numeric tower (Float, Integer, Double, etc.)
<li>let and case expressions
<li>guards
<li>list compreensions
<li>caracters and strings
<li>user-defined algebraic data types
</ul>
