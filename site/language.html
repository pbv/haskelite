    <h1>Haskelite language</h1>

    <p> This page describes the subset of Haskell accepted by the
    Haskelite interpreter.</p>
										  

<h2>Expressions</h2>

<p>Integers, characters, strings (i.e. lists of characters),
variables, arithmetic operations (+, -, *, div, mod), comparisons (==,
<=, etc.), tuples, lists, enumerations (e.g. [1..10]),
lambda-expressions, let and where local bindings, case
expressions.</p>
<p>Let and where bindings can only define single variables, not
patterns.</p>

       
<h2>Data type definitions</h2>
<p> Haskell-98 like <code>data</code> and <code>type</code>
 declarations; no record syntax, existentials or GADTs;
 no <code>deriving</code> (because there are no typeclasses); no
 higher-kinded types.
<p>

<p>Data types have structural equality and order (similar to
deriving Eq and Ord); these can fail at runtime (e.g. when attempting
to compare functions).</p>

<h2>Function definitions</h2>

<p>You can define functions using multiple equations with pattern
matching over integers, characters, lists and tuples, boolean guards,
and recursive definitions.</p>


<h2>Standard Prelude</h2>

Definitions for the following functions from the Standard Prelude are
provided.  Note that functions based on equality or ordering have an
overly polymorphic type (they should really have a typeclass
restriction); they will fail at runtime if you apply
them to function values.

<pre>
even, odd :: Int -> Bool
max, min :: a -> a -> a        -- NB: these are too polymorphic
compare :: a -> a -> Ordering  -- and may fail at runtime!
fst :: (a,b) -> a
snd :: (a,b) -> b
(&&), (||) :: Bool -> Bool
head :: [a] -> a
tail :: [a] -> [a]
(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
length :: [a] -> Int
reverse :: [a] -> [a]          -- NB: defined as naive reverse 
init :: [a] -> [a]
last :: [a] -> a  
sum, product :: [Int] -> Int
and, or :: [Bool] -> Bool
take, drop :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
maximum, minimum :: [a] -> a   -- NB: too polymorphic!
concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
repeat :: a -> [a]
cycle :: [a] -> [a]
iterate :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
foldl' :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
takeWhile, dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
any, all :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
chr :: Int -> Char
ord :: Char -> Int
isAlpha, isDigit, isAlphaNum, isUpper, isLower :: Char -> Bool
</pre>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>You can force evaluation to weak normal form using bang patterns (!)
in variable patterns. Alternatively, to force evaluation to full
normal form you can use the following built-in function:</p>
<pre>
force :: a -> a     -- evaluate to full normal form  
</pre>
<p>This behaves like identity function, except that it evaluates the
  argument fully.</p>
<p>Note that <code>force</code> will loose sharing in normal forms,
  e.g. a pair <code>(x,x)</code> with two identical (shared) values
  will be expanded into a pair with copies of the normal form of <code>x</code>.
</p>


<h2>Not implemented</h2>

The following Haskell 98 features are <em>not</em> (yet) implemented:

<ul>
<li>modules
<li>type classes 
<li>record syntax
<li>the numeric tower (Float, Integer, Double, Racional, etc.)
<li>list comprehensions
<li>declaring operators
<li>monadic operators and do-notation
</ul>
