`custom-elements.min.js` is from https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements. It is a polyfill, providing custom elements support for browsers that do not have it. In my testing, it enabled Firefox without the user having to set the `dom.webcomponents.customelements.enabled` true in `about:config`, but it did NOT work for IE or Edge.
